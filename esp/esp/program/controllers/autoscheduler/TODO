Frontend doesn't actually let you do multiple things at once?

Test the frontend to make sure that the display for schedule, unschedule, move,
and swap are all ok

Double-check that scoring is sane

Bugs:

AJAX scheduler should only link to the Autoscheduler Frontend if said module
exists.

search might try to unschedule sections multiple times

New features:
Implement a faster search
Return multiple results?

AJAX change log entries can include users

Add the license/LU header to all files

Implement ResourceMovementScorer


Reduce loading times?

Robustness:

save() might want to check to make sure that the lists of teachers teaching each
section don't change either

saving is probably really slow

be able to deal with schedules with multi-scheduled rooms

Tests and checks:
db tests should load resource criteria, constraints, scorers?
db test for save raising if there's a conflict or if someone moved the class
(??)
model tests for model functions
tests for resource checker
test manipulator, constraints, scoring???

need unittests for schedule operations and saving somehow
unittest for already-scheduled multihour class

scoring student-class-hours should account for classroom capacity

test to be able to handle sections which don't satsify constraints
